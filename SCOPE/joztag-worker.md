# Jožin Worker — Face Recognition and tagging (joztag)

## Purpose
The **jozag worker** is responsible for **face detection, recognition, and tagging** within the Jožin ecosystem. It identifies and groups faces across the image library, producing embeddings and optional person labels for efficient searching and organization.

## Planned Functionality
- Detect and align faces in images.
- Generate vector embeddings (e.g., ArcFace 512‑D) for similarity comparison.
- Match and cluster identical or similar faces.
- Allow user tagging and person identification.
- Sync embeddings and labels with the database.

## Status
Detailed functional and technical specification **TBD**.

This document serves as a **template placeholder** for future expansion once the face recognition pipeline is defined.
